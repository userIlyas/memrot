"""Target adapter contract.

The core engine (``runner/engine.py``) knows nothing about any specific
target: it only calls these methods.  A new system needs one adapter of
~40-100 lines; the attack catalogue, detectors and verdict logic are reused
unchanged.  This is the same "universal core, thin adapter" split garak
("generators") and promptfoo ("providers") use.

Only ``new_session`` and ``send`` are required.  Everything else has a
no-op / unsupported default so an adapter can start minimal and grow.
``capabilities()`` lets the runner degrade gracefully (``NOT_EVALUATED``,
never a crash) when a catalog variant asks for more than the bound adapter
can give -- mirroring ``mcp_audit``'s NOT_EVALUATED/NOT_APPLICABLE philosophy
for missing sources.
