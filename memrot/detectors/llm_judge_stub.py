"""An LLM judge asks an independent model whether the *injected behavior*
shows up (not just a literal token) -- needed once memory is summarized or
paraphrased and the literal canary no longer survives verbatim (this is
exactly the failure mode the project's own live run hit on MEM-02: the
target's finalize orchestrator paraphrases extracted facts before persisting
them, so a formatting-marker canary can vanish even though the underlying
fact was accepted).

Kept deliberately narrow: the judge is asked only whether a given marker
string is present or being honored in a piece of text -- it does not receive
``AttackVariant.rule_semantic`` or any other free-form rubric, because the
:class:`~memrot.detectors.base.Detector` contract (``detect(text, canary,
channel)``) is shared with :class:`LiteralDetector` and
:class:`GroundTruthDetector` and changing it would ripple into the runner
engine for all three. This narrower judge is still strictly more capable
than a literal substring match (it can recognize a paraphrased marker,
different casing, or a marker embedded in a rewritten sentence) without
touching the well-tested engine/verdict flow.

Uses its own, independently configured :class:`~memrot.mutation.llm_client.LLMClient`
-- a separate model slot from any mutation LLM, per this project's own note
that the model attacking a target and the model judging it should differ.

On any judge failure (timeout, malformed judgement, missing config), this
degrades to :class:`~memrot.detectors.literal.LiteralDetector` rather
than raising -- an unavailable judge must never turn a run into ERROR.
