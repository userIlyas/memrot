"""Attack-Success-Rate aggregation.

Denominator policy: only CONFIRMED and CLEAN count toward a GroupMetric's
``total`` (they are the two outcomes where the technique was actually
attempted and its effect could be observed). INVALID (stale contamination),
INCONCLUSIVE (insufficient observation), ERROR (adapter/transport failure) and NOT_EVALUATED (access profile not met)
are excluded from every ratio -- but never hidden: they are always visible
via ``counts_by_verdict``. A group with zero attempts displays "n/a (0/0)",
never a fabricated 0% or 100%.
