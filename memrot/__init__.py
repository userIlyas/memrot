"""memrot: multi-step attack harness for AI agent memory and tools.

Standalone package -- zero import dependency on ``mcp_audit``.  Alignment
with the auditor's vocabulary (rule ids such as ``MEM-02``, MITRE ATLAS
taxonomy ids) is by plain string tag only, via ``audit_bridge.py``, so this
package stays portable to any target that implements ``TargetAdapter``.
